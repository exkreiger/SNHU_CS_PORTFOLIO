## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room software was an online game where an image would be loaded over the course of 30 seconds and two teams would try to guess the image the fastest. The client was a successful online based company that wanted to move towards having napp built on multiple platforms.


## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I did well in analyzing multiple types of platforms for their posive and negative 
attributes in regard to the requirements that the client set forth. I found utilizing multiple layers of design in the same document helpful, such as being able to look through the domain requirements while analyzing other platforms. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have improved my work on the evaluations of platforms portion by splitting up the tables more to make the information more readable.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the need of keeping user data in sync across one game running on multiple clients to mean needing the data to exist singularly instead of being copied to each client. It is important to address user requirements first in order to provide a more accurate product and to avoid dissapointing the customer. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

This assignment was not about designing software nearly as much as it was analzing potential operating platforms for launching, running, and serving a distributed system. In the future, I would spend far less attention on the analysis stage and choose a suitable platform more quickly so I could focus on prototyping a working product.
