- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass system was proposed by the DriverPass team, and they were looking to build a system with the goal of providing online and in-person training for the DMV driving test. It would also provide online practice tests and a method to track the user’s progress towards proficiency. The system would allow for scheduling in-person driving training, and offer a method for the instructors to leave feedback for the new drivers. 

- What did you do particularly well?

Over the course of my design, I think that I broke down the activity diagrams well. I was able to appropriately identify the steps that lead through each process and I was also able to clearly articulate the use cases, which I think helped to guide the design of the system. This made it easier for me to map out the required functionality and understand how the different parts of the system would interact.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the use-case diagrams. While they provided a good overview of the system, I believe they could be improved by providing more details or breaking down complex scenarios into simpler ones. This would make the system functionality clearer and easier to understand.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In addressing the needs of the users in my system design, I made sure to incorporate features that would make the system user-friendly and efficient for both the instructors and the learners. Understanding user needs helps in designing a system that is not only functional, but also user-friendly and effective.

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to software design is iterative and user-centered. I start by clearly defining the problem and understanding the user's needs. After that, I brainstorm and create a map of the larger modules, then break these modules down into smaller components. In the future, I would apply techniques such as creating wireframes and flowcharts to help visualize the system design, and I would include more rounds of user feedback during the design process to ensure our visions were aligned and to possibly improve the designs even further.
