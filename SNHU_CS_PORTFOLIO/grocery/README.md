# SNHU_CS_PORTFOLIO
# CS210 Submission - Grocery, Project 3

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was a mock for aggregating user data on a set of shopping list information. The probem it was solving was counting instances of the same item and writing the results to a file.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think my class "GroceryFiling" was put together well and was easy to follow. I also made sure to factor the code in such a way that mapping the keys and values and printing to the output file happened at the same time, which I was happy with.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code could be expanded to allow the user to enter new items and give the item a quantity manually. Also, the code could have sanitized the input to ignore capitilization differences.


## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
There wasn't a most challenging portion I can think of, but the challenge was more that I would forget how to perform some operation (like file i/o for instance) and would have to re-learn this material briefly. Also, implementing the iterator for the map was a new concept that was somewhat challenging.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning to use a map to store keys and values and how to iterate over the map was very useful and will no doubt come in handy later on.


## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to respond to past notes and use more comments than I am used to, and especially expanded on portions of the code that were new to me.
